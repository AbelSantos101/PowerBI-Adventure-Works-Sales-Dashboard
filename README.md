# PowerBI-Adventure-Works-Sales-Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard provides insights into sales performance for Adventure Works. It enables salespeople, managers, and VPs to view sales metrics based on their role using row-level security.

The main page shows photos and names of each sales rep. Clicking on a photo navigates to a detailed individual view with sales performance over time, top products, regions, and more.

## Key Features


  *  Individual sales rep performance view with lifetime sales, yearly sales, target performance, and trends
  *  Ability to filter by year, sales group, and country
  *  Comparative analysis against previous years
  *  Top selling products and regions for each rep
  *  Executive view for managers and VPs

## Data Sources

The data source is a Star Schema database modeled from Adventure Works data with fact and dimensional tables sourced from a Kaggle dataset.

## Dashboard Structure

The dashboard has two pages. Page 1 shows the overview and sales rep photos.
